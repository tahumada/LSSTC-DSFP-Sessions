# Improve-A-Viz Exercise

In this exercise, you will take an existing data visualization and improve it. All visualizations come from professional organizations, newspapers and other media outlets. All of them have serious flaws. 

Your task for this session is to pick a figure and make a new version of it (the link for the folder with the figures will be shared in class). The data required for each is included in each figure. You can use the same kind of plot, or pick a different one. You can change axes, fonts, colours, markers, or whatever else you think may make a better figure.
You will have the opportunity to share your new figure with the group on Wednesday.

Some guiding questions and suggestions:
* What is the key message of the figure? What information needs to be easy to take away without spending much time on it?
* Is the current type of plot the best choice? Why? Why not? What other types of visualization might be more appropriate/expressive/useful?
* Can you improve on the visual hierarchy of the figure? How can you make the important information pop out?
* All of these figures contain the actual numbers. For this exercise, that is convenient, but in general, it is a flaw: if you need all relevant data to be on the figure for it to be understandable, it is not that much better than a table. Can you think of ways to make the main message clear without having all the data on the figure?

### Bonus Exercise
If you are done with your figure: the most *creative* (visually engaging and/or funny) re-interpretation of dataviz_improve4.jpg (as judged by the lecturers) will receive a free beverage.
