    "You're going to use the Python package `scikit-learn` to attack a number of problems which are best handled with unsupervised machine learning algorithms (models). In scikit-learn, different models are accessed via the various modules with user-defined tuning parameters. Data (features) for the models are stored in a 2D numpy array, `X`, with each row representing an individual object and each column a specific feature. Unsupervised models are invoked by calling `.fit(X)`. Once a model has fit a data set, it can be used to generate observations for a new data set `Xnew` by calling `.predict(Xnew)`. Any other method calls are described in the documentation.\n",
