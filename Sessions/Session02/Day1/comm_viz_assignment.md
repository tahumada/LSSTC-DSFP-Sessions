# Science Communication Project

For DSFP Session 2, you and your partner will develop a short presentation (6 min + 4 min for questions) to be delivered on Friday afternoon. Both students must talk during the presentation. The presentation should accomplish the following:
    
1. You must summarize and teach something you learned this week. The intended level is graduate students that are not experts in machine learning.
2. Throughout the week we will encounter the [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package repeatedly. While `scikit-learn` is an amazing tool, with exceptional documentation, many of the corresponding figures could be improved. Using what you have learned about data visualization throughout the week, download the source code for a `scikit-learn` figure, and make substantial changes to improve whatever the figure is attempting to communicate.
3. If possible, it's best if 2. relates to 1. (In other words, we would like for you to improve a figure in `scikit-learn` from the lesson you intend to teach.) In some cases this may not be possible, for example the figures may already be perfect or too complex to re-work in one week, so this is not a requirement.

The presentations must be made as `iPython` slide shows, and they must be submitted, via github pull requests, by 12:30 pm on Friday.
