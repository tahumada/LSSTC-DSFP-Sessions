# Science Platforms Exercises

The problems associated with the Science Platforms lecture required the execution of queries within a jupyter notebook on the [CasJobs](https://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/) interface pointing to the SDSS database. For this reason, there is no associated jupyter notebook. 

Students were asked to solve the following problems: 

1. Create a new python notebook that includes

    a) The CROSS APPLY query that you created yesterday to find neighbors of the selected objects
    b)	Modify the query to obtain the distance between each object and its neighbor (hint: use a user-defined function for this)
    c)	Run the query on CasJobs in batch mode
    d)	Read the resulting MyDB table into the noteboo
    e)	Get JPEG cutouts for all the objects from SkyServer, with each cutout big enough to include the neighbors you found
    f)	After you are done, save the notebook in your Storage folder

2.	Compare SciServer with other science platforms
    a) Evaluate comparative merits, features, whatâ€™s missing
