## Day 0 – The Beginning | Introduction for the New Cohort

"The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

## Day 1 – Bayes or Bust? | (Probability and Introduction to Bayes)

"On voit, par cet Essai, que la théorie des probabilités n'est, au fond, que le bon sens réduit au calcul."

(One sees, from this Essay, that the theory of probabilities is basically just common sense reduced to calculus.)

-- Pierre-Simon Laplace
