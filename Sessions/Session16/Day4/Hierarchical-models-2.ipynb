    "# Hierarchical Models 2: Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples in the Hierarchical Models 1 notebook, our models have assumed that all of the objects we observe are true members of the population we want to model (e.g., star cluster, or all of the RV systems we had were binary star systems). We very rarely have this luxury: We typically have a complex superposition of multiple structures, or at least two components corresponding to an object of interest and the \"field\" or \"background\" population of objects. Another similar context in which a one-component population model would not be sufficient is when there are outliers in a dataset. For these contexts, the models we wrote down and explored in Hierarchical Models 1 are too simple to be useful for many real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of handling datasets that contain objects from different populations or outliers is to use a *mixture model*. Because of how many problems have this structure, I personally think that mixture models are one of the most important tools to know as a data-oriented astronomer. Let's first talk about the fundamentals of mixture models and then explore an example of using a mixture model to measure the distance to a star cluster using Gaia data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the models we have looked at so far, any parameter or variable is either drawn from a single distribution (e.g., a single normal distribution in many cases) or is deterministically related to another variable (e.g., distance and parallax). However, this does not have to be the case: the underlying density distribution of a random variable could instead be a more complex thing, such as a mixture of multiple component distributions that each have their own parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common and important example used in many statistics and machine learning applications is the *Gaussian Mixture Model* (GMM), in which the probability density $p(x | \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ of some variable $x$ given parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is modeled as a sum of Gaussians each with a weight $w$. For example, for $K$ Gaussian mixture components, the GMM density is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x | \\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \n",
    "    \\sum_k^K w_k \\, \\mathcal{N}(x | \\mu_k, \\sigma_k^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sum_k^K w_k = 1$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (\\mu_1, \\mu_2, ..., \\mu_k)$, and again $\\mathcal{N}(x \\,|\\, \\mu, \\sigma^2)$ represents a univariate normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ (i.e. $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{N}(x \\,|\\, \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\, \\sigma} \\, \n",
    "    \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\,\\sigma^2} \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the constraint on the sum of the weights, this GMM density still integrates to 1 and is therefore a valid probability density function, but now can have complex possibly multi-modal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Fitting a line to data with Gaussian outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "As a demonstration of using a Gaussian Mixture Model to handle outliers, we will return to the example case of fitting a straight line to data, but now we will assume that the data we have been given include outliers.\n",

    "The outliers have clearly biased our fit and led us to infer parameters for this linear model that are not consistent with the truth. Let's now construct a model to deal with these outlier data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we will use a *Gaussian Mixture Model* as a way of modeling the true density of objects, with one mixture component to represent the objects that follow the linear relation as we expect, and a second mixture component to represent the outliers. When constructing an outlier model, it sometimes helps to know about why these objects are outliers and to explicitly write down a generative model for the process that leads to these other data. This adds a little additional complexity to a model, but allows us to be more justified in our choice of outlier model and can lead to more precise inferences of the parameters you actually want to learn. Plus, as we saw, if you use MCMC methods to generate posterior samples over all of the parameters (inlier and outlier model components), you can use these samples to marginalize over the outlier model and obtain robust estimates of the inlier model. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes you don't know about the outliers, or you don't care and just need to get something working as a prototype. In these cases, using a broad Gaussian or other wide distribution to capture the outliers is often a good practical choice. That's the assumption we will work with her for our simulated data: We will assume the inlier data are generated from a straight line with Gaussian uncertainties, and the outlier distribution is a Gaussian centered on zero with an unknown variance. With mixture weights $\\boldsymbol{w}=(w_1, w_2)$ such that $w_1 + w_2 = 1$, data $y$ and uncertainties $\\sigma_y$, and outlier component standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\rm out}$, this model looks like:"

    "1. Implement a 1D mixture model to infer which stars in this field are plausible members of NGC 6819 using only the proper motion in RA (`g.pmra` and `g.pmra_error` for the proper motion values and uncertainties). Also measure the mean proper motion of the cluster. You can represent the cluster component as a Gaussian, but the field population is clearly not Gaussian â€” use a different distribution to capture the field. *Hint: you could use a GMM for the field, and mix that with another Gaussian component to represent the cluster.* This requires a slight extension of the model used above.

You can represent the cluster component as a Gaussian, but the field population is clearly not Gaussian â€” use a different distribution to capture the field population. *Hint: you could try using a Beta distribution, or you could implement a custom distribution to implement an exponentially decreasing space density prior as defined and demonstrated in [Bailer-Jones et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127..994B/abstract). If you go with the latter, you will need to use the `pymc.DensityDist()` class â€” ask Adrian for some tips if interested!* This requires mashing together the hierarchical model we implemented in notebook 1 with the mixture models above. (**intermediate difficulty**)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Implement a 3D mixture model using both proper motion components to infer the mean proper motion vector of NGC 6819. You can represent the cluster component as a 2D isotropic Gaussian, but the field population is clearly not Gaussian or isotropic â€” use a different 2D distribution to capture the field population. *Hint: you could try using a mixture of Gaussians. Note also that the proper motions have covariances, reported via the `pmra_pmdec_corr` column! â€” if you are interested in implementing this and get stuck, ask Adrian for some other tips to get started.* (**hard**)\n",
