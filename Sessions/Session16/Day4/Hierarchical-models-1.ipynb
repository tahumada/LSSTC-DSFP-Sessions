    "Most of the probabilistic models we have discussed so far have been *one-level* models: In these cases, the data are generated by some functional model that has parameters, and those parameters are random variables assumed to be drawn from fixed prior probability distributions. Hierarchical models are also called *multi-level* models because they take these ideas and expand and generalize them to consider models that may have multiple levels or layers of random variables that generate the data. For example, if we have data $D$ and some parameters $\\theta$, in a one-level model the join distribution $p(D, \\theta)$ is often factorized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(D, \\theta) = p(D | \\theta) \\, p(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(D | \\theta)$ is the \"likelihood\" and $p(\\theta)$ is the \"prior.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-level model, the parameters closest to the data, $\\theta$, are themselves generated by some stochastic process that is governed by another set of random variables or parameters known as \"hyper-parameters,\" sometimes denoted as $\\alpha$. In such a case, the joint probability could be factorized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(D, \\theta, \\alpha) = p(D | \\theta) \\, p(\\theta | \\alpha) \\, p(\\alpha)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this case (and as is often the case), the data only depends on $\\alpha$ through the relationship between $\\theta$ and $\\alpha$, but this is not a requirement. A graphical model for this (general) case would look like:"

    "- **Exoplanet (or binary-star) period or eccentricity distribution**: Here the raw data is usually light curves with transits or eclipses, but the parameters one wants to know are the properties of the period distribution or eccentricity distribution of the systems. A model therefore has the true period/eccentricity for each system, but then some parameters that govern the distribution of periods/eccentricities.\n",

One way of doing this inference would be to construct a hierarchical model that predicts redshifts given the mean velocity and dispersion of a galaxy cluster by simultaneously inferring the true velocity of each member galaxy given its (noisy) redshift measurement.\n",
    "- **Color–magnitude fitting / stellar population modeling**: The observed data here are the magnitudes of stars in a number of photometric bands, and maybe also spectroscopic parameters, and the parameters one wants to infer are properties of the stellar population like the distribution of ages, metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages.\n",

    "This source has 36 velocity measurements, and the velocity data is already plotted in the upper left panel of the figure above. What model should we use to measure the period of the orbit? In general, when modeling radial velocity curves from two-body systems (e.g., star–star or star–planet systems), we should use Keplerian dynamics to construct a proper model for the radial velocity given period, eccentricity, and etc. (for example, using the [exoplanet](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/) package or [thejoker](https://thejoker.rtfd.io/)). However, in this case, we have prior knowledge that these systems all have negligible eccentricities (i.e. very close to 0): Under this assumption, a good model for the velocities is a sinusoid with an overall offset (the mean velocity). With this setup, we have two choices:\n",
    "1. We could fit a model like $v_r = a \\, \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\, t}{P} + \\phi \\right) + v_0$, where $a$ is the amplitude, $P$ is the period, $\\phi$ is a phase offset, and $v_0$ is the mean (systemic) velocity.\n",
    "2. Equivalently, we could fit a model $v_r = a \\, \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\, t}{P}\\right) + b \\, \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\, t}{P}\\right) + v_0$, where $a$ and $b$ are amplitudes and all other parameters are the same.\n",
    "These two models are different parametrizations of the same physical model for the data (a sinusoid), so how should we pick between them?\n",
    "\n",
    "This relates to one of the trickiest and most important aspects of doing statistical inference in practice: choosing a good parametrization so that optimization and sampling is efficient and successful. We could spend an entire tutorial just talking about this, but we won't go into much detail about this here. For this particular example, we will choose the 2nd parametrization: A key difference between 1. and 2. above is that 1. has two linear parameters and two nonlinear parameters ($P$ and $\\phi$), whereas 2. has three linear parameters and one nonlinear parameter ($P$). It is often a good idea to try to reduce the number of nonlinear parameters you have in a model because then certain marginalizations or integrals over your likelihood function may have closed form solutions (thus allowing you to reduce the number of parameters and speed up optimization or sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the parametrization 2. above, we have four parameters: $a, b, P, v_0$. The posterior pdf over these parameters given the observed $J$ radial velocities indexed by $j$ is:\n",

    "Well done! In this tutorial, we learned about *hierarchical models* and implemented a multi-level model to infer the log-period distribution of binary-star systems with real data from the APOGEE surveys. The concepts we discussed here should serve as building blocks that you can put together and extend into much more complex inference problems. There are many examples of hierarchical models in the (recent) astronomical literature, but here are a few papers that span a range of domain topics:\n",
