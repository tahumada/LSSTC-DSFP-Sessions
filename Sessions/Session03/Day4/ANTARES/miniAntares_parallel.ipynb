    "Building (and managing) a database from scratch is a challenging task. For (very) small projects one solution to this problem is to use [`SQLite`](http://sqlite.org/), which is a self-contained, publicly available SQL engine. One of the primary advantages of `SQLite` is that no server setup is required, unlike other popular tools such as postgres and MySQL. In fact, `SQLite` is already integrated with python so everything we want to do (create database, add tables, load data, write queries, etc.) can be done within Python.\n",

    "*Disadvantages*\n",

    "1. Client/Server applications (`SQLite` does not behave well if multiple systems need to access db at the same time)\n",
    "2. Very large data sets (`SQLite` stores entire db in a single disk file, other solutions can store data across multiple files/volumes)\n",
    "3. High concurrency (Only 1 writer allowed at a time for `SQLite`)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the (limited) lists above, you can see that while `SQLite` is perfect for our application right now, if you were building an actual ANTARES-like system a more sophisticated database solution would be required.  "

    "## Problem 6) Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned earlier - one of the primary goals of ANTARES is to reduce the stream of 10 million alerts on any given night to the single (or 10, or 100) most interesting objects. One possible definition of \"interesting\" is rarity - in which case it would be useful to add some form of anomaly detection to the pipeline. `scikit-learn` has [several different algorithms](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/covariance/plot_outlier_detection.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-covariance-plot-outlier-detection-py) that can be used for anomaly detection. Here we will employ [isolation forest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html) which has many parallels to random forests, which we have previously learned about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, isolation forest builds an ensemble of decision trees where the splitting parameter in each node of the tree is selected randomly. In each tree the number of branches necessary to isolate each source is measured - outlier sources will, on average, require fewer splittings to be isolated than sources in high-density regions of the feature space. Averaging the number of branchings over many trees results in a relative ranking of the anomalousness (*yes, I just made up a word*) of each source."

    "## Challenge Problem) Simulate a Real ANTARES\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we just completed features a key difference from the true ANTARES system - namely, all the light curves analyzed had a complete set of observations loaded into the database. One of the key challenges for LSST (and by extension ANTARES) is that the data will be *streaming* - new observations will be available every night, but the full light curves for all sources won't be available until the 10 yr survey is complete. In this problem, you will use the same data to simulate an LSST-like classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that your training set (i.e. the first 100 sources loaded into the database) were observed prior to LSST, thus, these light curves can still be used in their entirety to train your classification models. For the test set of observations, simulate LSST by determining the min and max observation date and take 1-d quantized steps through these light curves. On each day when there are new observations, update the feature calculations for every source that has been newly observed. Classify those sources and identify possible anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things you should think about as you build this software:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should you use the entire light curves for training-set objects when classifying sources with only a few data points?\n",
    "2. How are you going to handle objects on the first epoch when they are detected?\n",
    "3. What threshold (if any) are you going to set to notify the community about rarities that you have discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint* - Since you will be reading these light curves from the database (and not from text files) the `ANTARESlc` class that we previously developed will not be useful. You will (likely) either need to re-write this class to interact with the database or figure out how to massage the query results to comply with the class definitions."
